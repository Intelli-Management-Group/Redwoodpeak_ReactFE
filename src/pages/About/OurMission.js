              Redwood Peak is run for the benefit of its investors and employees whose objectives are
              completely aligned. Profit without performance, size for its own sake, socially irresponsible
              investing, and the unilateral prosperity of employees without investors are to be rejected.
              Our firm should be successful if we work hard to attain investment excellence and integrity
              while placing the interests of our clients first.
