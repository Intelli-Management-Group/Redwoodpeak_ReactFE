                                Our investment process begins with identifying mispriced companies relative to their intrinsic value. In addition, we evaluate the quality and durability of a company’s business, the track record of a management team, and the underlying industry and macroeconomic trends. Redwood Peak’s investment edge is our extensive local network of relationships built over 45 years of combined investment experience. Our approach to portfolio construction involves risk assessment balanced with portfolio concentration versus diversification.
